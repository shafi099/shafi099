## Projects

- [CinePass - Online Movie Ticket Booking Portal](https://shafi099.github.io/CinePass.github.io/index.html) : CinePass, an online movie ticket booking portal that I designed and developed from scratch! Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a seamless and immersive experience for users to easily select their movie, date, time, and seat(s) of choice. The project challenged me to hone my skills in front-end development and provided me with valuable experience in user interface design. I'm proud of what I've accomplished and can't wait to see where my skills take me next! 

- [Telugu - Cine Buzz Static Webpage](https://shafi099.github.io/TeluguCineBuzz-Static-Webpage.github.io/) : The website you linked to, TeluguCineBuzz-Static-Webpage, is a static webpage project hosted on GitHub. From what I can see, the website is dedicated to Telugu cinema news and updates. It appears that the webpage has been developed using HTML and CSS. The HTML markup is used to structure the webpage's content, while the CSS is used for styling the webpage's layout and appearance. Overall, TeluguCineBuzz-Static-Webpage looks like a well-designed and informative website for Telugu cinema enthusiasts.
